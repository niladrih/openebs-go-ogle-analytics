## Go-ogle Analytics

Track and monitor your Go programs for free with Google Analytics

The `ga` package is essentially a Go wrapper around the [Google Analytics - Measurement Protocol (Google Analytics 4)](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag)

### Install

```
go get -v github.com/openebs/go-ogle-analytics
```

### API

Create a new `client` and `Send()` an 'event'.

### Quick Usage

1. Log into GA and create a new property and note its Measurement ID

2. Create a `ga-test.go` file

	``` go
	package main

	import (
        gaClient "github.com/openebs/go-ogle-analytics/client"
        gaEvent "github.com/openebs/go-ogle-analytics/event"
	)

	func main() {
	    client, err := gaClient.NewMeasurementClient(
            gaClient.WithApiSecret("yourApiSecret"),
            gaClient.WithMeasurementId("G-yourMeasurementClient"),
            gaClient.WithClientId("uniqueUserId-000000001"),
	    )
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }

        event, err := gaEvent.NewOpenebsEvent(
            gaEvent.WithCategory("Foo"),
            gaEvent.WithAction("Bar"),
            gaEvent.WithLabel("Baz"),
            gaEvent.WithValue(19072023),
        )
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }

        err = client.Send(event)
        if err != nil {
            panic(err)
        }

        println("Event fired!")
 	}

	```

3. In GA, go to Report > Realtime

4. Run `ga-test.go`

	```
	$ go run ga-test.go
	Event fired!
	```

5. Watch as your event appears
